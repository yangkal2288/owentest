"""check_vo_spacing.py: check that voice pieces cut from one take are placed at their recorded spacing.

The principle: an act is recorded as one continuous take so its lines share a breath, a pitch contour
and a pace. split_takes.py then cuts it into pieces so pictures and captions can hang off each line.
The moment a timing plan moves one of those pieces by even a few hundred milliseconds, the pause
between them stops being the narrator's pause and the delivery sounds stitched. Pieces that belong to
one breath group must keep the gap they were recorded with; pieces from the same take that are not
grouped may be respaced on purpose, and this script reports by how much.

What it checks, per voice line in the plan:
  - breath groups (pieces sharing a "breath" name in vo.json): the gap between consecutive speech
    onsets in the plan must equal the recorded gap, within --tol seconds. Otherwise: ERROR, with the
    onset that restores the recorded spacing;
  - pieces of one take must play in take order, and no line may start before the previous line's
    speech has ended (overlapping voice). Both are ERRORs;
  - other neighbours from the same take: the respacing is reported (INFO). --strict turns every
    same-take neighbour into a breath group.

Usage:
  python3 check_vo_spacing.py plan.json vo.json [--voice narrator] [--tol 0.02] [--strict] [--json out.json]

plan.json: the timing table, either PLAN-shaped  {"vo": [["l01", 0.4, {...}], ["l02", 2.3], ...]}
           or the film data render.ts extracts    {"vo": [{"id": "l01", "onset": 0.4}, ...]}.
           An onset is where the line's SPEECH starts on the film timeline.
vo.json:   the file split_takes.py writes: {"<id>": {source, source_offset, on, off, take_order, breath?}}.
           A vo-data style object keyed by voice ({"narrator": {"<id>": {...}}}) works with --voice.

Exit status 1 if any ERROR. Requirements: Python 3.8+, no packages.
